## About Me

<!-- I am now a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Institute of Theoretical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.
I received my Ph.D. degree from the School of Systems Science, Beijing Normal University in 2023 (co-supervised by [Prof. Jiang Zhang](https://jake.swarma.org/) and [Prof. Pan Zhang](http://home.itp.ac.cn/~panzhang/)).
Prior to that, I graduated from the Department of Physics, Beijing Normal University in 2018. 
I previously served as a Senior Research Specialist in Zhejiang Lab. -->

I am now a tenure-track assistant professor at the [School of Physical Science and Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications](https://spst.bupt.edu.cn/). 
I received my Ph.D. degree from the School of Systems Science, Beijing Normal University in 2023, and completed postdoctoral research at the [Institute of Theoretical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://itp.cas.cn/).
My research interests lie in statistical physics and machine learning. 
I have published in Nature Communications and Physical Review E, and leads a project supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China.
