## About Me

My name is Jing Liu and I’m a Ph.D. student in School of Systems Science, Beijing Normal University. 

My current research interest is the interdisciplinary between unsupervised machine learning, tensor network, statistical physics and combinatorial optimization problems.

 Here is my [CV](./CV.pdf) and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MI6oTxsAAAAJ&hl=en).
