## About Me
I am  now a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Institute of Theoretical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.
I received my Ph.D. degree from the School of Systems Science, Beijing Normal University in 2023 (co-supervised by [Prof. Jiang Zhang](https://jake.swarma.org/) and [Prof. Pan Zhang](http://home.itp.ac.cn/~panzhang/)).
Prior to that, I graduated from the Department of Physics, Beijing Normal University in 2018. 
I previously served as a Senior Research Specialist in Zhejiang Lab.
